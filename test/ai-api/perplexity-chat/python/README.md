To modify the given Python script to utilize a secret variable for the API key stored in a `.env` file in the working directory, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a `.env` file** in your working directory with the content:
   ```
   API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
   ```
   Make sure to replace the API key value with your actual API key.

2. **Modify the Python script** to load the API key from the `.env` file using the `python-dotenv` package and the `os` module to access environment variables.

Here's how you can modify the script:

```python
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Retrieve API key from environment variables
api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')

url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"

payload = {
    "model": "mistral-7b-instruct",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "message is here"
        }
    ]
}
headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "content-type": "application/json",
    "authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

### Steps Explained:

- **Importing Necessary Modules**: The script imports `load_dotenv` from the `python-dotenv` package to load the environment variables from the `.env` file. It also imports `os` to access these variables.

- **Loading Environment Variables**: `load_dotenv()` is called to load the environment variables from the `.env` file into the script's environment.

- **Retrieving the API Key**: `os.getenv('API_KEY')` retrieves the value of the `API_KEY` variable from the environment, which was loaded from the `.env` file.

- **Using the API Key in the Request**: The `authorization` header in the `headers` dictionary is modified to use the `api_key` variable. The `f"Bearer {api_key}"` syntax is a formatted string that inserts the value of `api_key` into the string.

### Additional Steps:

- **Install python-dotenv**: If you haven't already, you need to install the `python-dotenv` package. You can do this by running `pip install python-dotenv` in your terminal or command prompt.

- **.env File Security**: Ensure the `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore` file if you're using Git. This prevents the file from being tracked and uploaded to version control, keeping your secrets safe
